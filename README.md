# video_assignment
Simple QML-based program for users to load their video.

This QML-based program allows users to load a video file of their choice through a File Picker dialog. It provides intuitive controls such as play and pause buttons, as well as a progress slider. 
The slider allows users to easily navigate through the video by dragging and seeking to different playback positions. 
It's worth noting that this program does not utilize Qt widgets or Qt quick controls. Both the pause and play buttons, as well as the progress slider are components built from scratch.
